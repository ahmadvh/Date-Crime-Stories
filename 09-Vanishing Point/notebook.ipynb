    "\n",
    "Riley, an experienced solo hiker, vanished during a weekend trek in Pinecrest National Park. Park rangers found Riley‚Äôs abandoned tent and a dropped GPS device. Reviewing GPS trail logs, drone surveillance, and campsite reservations, investigators noticed something odd: Riley‚Äôs path overlapped with another hiker who wasn‚Äôt registered at any campsite. The drone footage captured two figures at dusk near a remote ridge, though only Riley‚Äôs name appears in the official records.\n",
