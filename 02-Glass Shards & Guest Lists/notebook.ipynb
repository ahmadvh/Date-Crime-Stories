    "During a lavish wedding on a secluded island, the bride‚Äôs priceless necklace disappears from the locked bridal suite. Only 30 guests were present, and the island is accessible only by boat. The power went out briefly at 21:15, and the boathouse motion sensors recorded unusual activity. The wine cellar inventory also shows unexpected discrepancies. Was it a guest, or did someone on the staff betray the trust? Analyze the data to uncover who had the opportunity and motive to steal the necklace.\n",
