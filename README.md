# 🕵️ Data Crime Series  

Welcome to the **Data Crime Series** — a collection of interactive data science mysteries.  

Each case is a self-contained project where you’ll play detective, analyzing datasets to uncover what really happened. From **stolen jewels at a gala** to **unexplained events in a hospital**, you’ll solve cases step by step using **Python, Pandas, and data visualization**.  

📂 Inside each case you’ll find:  
- A **Jupyter Notebook** with guided analysis  
- **CSV datasets** tied to the mystery  

✨ The goal: Learn Python & data analysis while having fun solving mysteries.  

No spoilers — you’ll uncover the truth by running the notebooks yourself.
